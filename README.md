Ai enumeration to the end of the iterator, guaranteed!

Are you tired of artificial intelligence being lazy, are you tired of truncated results, are you tired of enumeration?
We created this project to solve one of the major issues that still exist with current AI chat bots and allow you to have hands free enumeration of the complete iterator regardless if it is a collection of 10, 100, or 10K.
